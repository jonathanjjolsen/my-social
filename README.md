# Social Experiment

## Description:
This application is designed to mimic the early stages of a social media website. It allows the user to manipulate users, friends, thoughts, and reactions by utilizing express endpoints. This API was built using Node.js and Mongoose. Mongoose utilizes a document structured database instead of the relational style used by MySQL. This makes the creation of the database and its contents much easier to manipulate.
