# Social Experiment

## Description:
This application is designed to mimic the early stages of a social media website. It allows the user to manipulate users, friends, thoughts, and reactions by utilizing express endpoints. This API was built using Node.js and Mongoose. Mongoose utilizes a document structured database instead of the relational style used by MySQL. This makes the creation of the database and its contents much easier to manipulate.

## The Challenge

### Assigned User Story:
```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

### Acceptance Criteria:
```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```
